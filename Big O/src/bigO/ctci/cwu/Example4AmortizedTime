Amortized time allows us to describe that, yes, this worst case happens every once in a while.
But once it happens, it won't happen again for so long that the cost is "amortized."

Example:

An array COULD be full. If this array contains 999 elements, then inserting a new element will take O(999) time:
step1: create new array of size 2(999) --> has a resize cost
step2: copy the original 999 elements over to this new array
step3: insert new element

resize cost = 1+2+4+8+16+...+X
            = X + X/2 + X/4 + ... + 1
            = 2X



--> However, this does NOT happen often.
      --> Amortized time is O(1)
